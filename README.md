# Automate the Boring Stuff

Participants in the Virtual Circumpolar Race Across the World (CRAW) have to log their daily activities in the RunSignup platform. I found it quite bothersome to dutifully track my activities with the Strava app and then have to manually type them all into RunSignup. Hence I created this little program to automate said daily process.
